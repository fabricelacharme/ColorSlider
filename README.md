# ColorSlider
A slider/trackbar control in C#

![GitHub Logo](/gifs/colorslider.jpg)

ColorSlider is a slider/trackbar control written in C# (Windows Forms).
This is an alternative/replacement to the standard Microsoft Visual Studio trackbar control which is not so flexible and lack basic functionalities.

The code is a free interpretation of the original code from Michal Brylka published in the site Code Project.

See https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/17395/Owner-drawn-trackbar-slider

The main enhancements brought by this control are
* a less surface
* the possibility to parametrize the shape of the thumb or to replace it by an image.
* subdivisions added between main divisions.
* the text value of the main divisions.
* many colors parametrization added (ticks, bar, elapsed) 
* the orientation can be horizontal and vertical (starting from the bottom)


# Events:
* ValueChanged
* Scroll

Typical usage of ValueChanged event:

     private void colorSlider1_ValueChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
     {
         label1.Text = colorSlider1.Value.ToString();
     }

# How does it works?
The control is drawn in the overrided event "OnPaint",  depending if it is enabled or not, and if the mouse is over it or not.
* If not enabled, the colors are desaturated.
* If the mouse is over, the colors are lighten.
* Else, the colors are those choosen in the property box.

Depending on these colors, the function "DrawColorSlider" is called and draw everything.

3 rectangles are mainly used to draw the control:
* barRect is used to draw the bar (Elapsed and remaining)
* thumbRect is used to draw the thumb.
* elapsedRect is the rectangle for the elapsed bar (the left of the thumb if the orientation is horizontal)

The elapsed bar is composed of 3 single lines (inner, top and bottom), having each its own color:
```
// Draw horizontal elapsed inner line with "DrawLine" function
// x1 = barRect.X
// y1 = barRect.Y + barRect.Height / 2
// x2 = barRect.X + elapsedRect.Width
// y2 = y1
e.Graphics.DrawLine(new Pen(elapsedInnerColorPaint, 1f), x1, y1, x2, y2);
```
top and bottom lines are drawn 1 pixel above or under the inner line. A vertical line of 3 pixels is added at the beginning to improve the 3D effect.

The rest of the bar is also composed of 3 single lines (inner, top and bottom), having each its own color. A vertical line of 3 pixels is added at the end to improve the 3D effect.

The thumb is drawn according to whether it is an image or not:
* Image: `<e.Graphics.DrawImage(bmp, thumbRect, srceRect, GraphicsUnit.Pixel);>`
* Drawn by the control, with a linear gradient `<e.Graphics.DrawPath(thumbPen, thumbPath);>`

The ticks and texts are drawn in two nested loops
* a first loop from 0 to ScaleDividion for the main graduations and texts
* a nested loop from 0 to ScaleSubDivision for the subdivisions

The offset between each tick is a multiple of `<W/(nbticks -1)>` where:
* W is the width of the bar minus the width of the thumb, in order that when the thumb is at minimum position or maximum position, the graduation coincide with the middle of the thumb
* nbticks is the number of graduations including subdivisions: `<nbticks = 1 + _scaleDivisions * _scaleSubDivisions>`

So, as you see, nothing very difficult in this control. You just have to draw lines and calculate precisely where they start and where they end...
